# Improved Heart Failure Prediction using Model Screening platform
## Best poster award at JMP discovery Summit 2023

## Introductiom

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally, claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives in 2019, accounting for 32% of all deaths worldwide that year.【1】
Developed a classification model for classifying Heart disease. Leveraged predictions using  Model Screening, Model Comparison, and Dashboard feature in JMP 16. The model output will help in understanding the importance of factors leading to heart disease and the probability of developing heart disease under certain conditions.
## Objective:
To build the best model and also to find factors that are leading to heart failure.

## Methodology

The data set included 918 participants from different countries and 11 factors associated with heart failure, such as age, sex, blood pressure, blood glucose.
Performed pre-processing of data by exploring null values and outliers. Further, performed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the importance and relationship of each feature in relation to heart failure.

To build the model,  we incorporated the following JMP-16 capabilities in our methodology.
### Model Screening: An efficient platform for simultaneously fitting, comparing, exploring, selecting, and then deploying the best predictive model. 
### Model Comparison: Enables easy to compare and select the best-performing predictive model.
### Dashboards: Efficient way to better represent EDA concisely also it can be run anytime as new data is available.
