# Improved Heart Failure Prediction using Model Screening platform
## Best poster award at JMP discovery Summit 2023

## Introductiom

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally, claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives in 2019, accounting for 32% of all deaths worldwide that year.【1】
Developed a classification model for classifying Heart disease. Leveraged predictions using  Model Screening, Model Comparison, and Dashboard feature in JMP 16. The model output will help in understanding the importance of factors leading to heart disease and the probability of developing heart disease under certain conditions.
## Objective:
To build the best model and also to find factors that are leading to heart failure.
